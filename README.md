# React Tabs App

This is project showing different user biographies based on what user currently is set. For example if user clicks on user#2, his biography will be shown, while others will not be rendered. Basically, the whole idea is: If user clicks on object with index N, send object on that index to highlighted tab and display all that should be displayed (such as name, position, biography and more info link that is dynamically rendered).
